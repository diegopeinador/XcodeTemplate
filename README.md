This template adds an overlay to the icon with the working environment and the version. It's also prepared to use cocoapods and fastlane. Just modify the relevant files before coping it to "~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates" folder (create if doesn't exist).

Requirements:
* [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org)
* [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools)
* A couple of commandline tools: "imagemagick" and "ghostscript" easy install with [brew](http://brew.sh)
